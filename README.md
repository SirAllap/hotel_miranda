# Sprint 1 - HTML and CSS | HOTEL MIRANDA
## Introduction
In this sprint, your task is to create the layout of the website that users will access to obtain information and/or make reservations at Hotel Miranda.

## Materials
You can find the detailed design of all the pages to be developed, both in mobile and desktop versions, in the Materials section. You should aim to create as many pages as possible, but keep in mind that it's expected that you may not be able to finish everything.

Therefore, it's essential to organize your time throughout the training to work on the remaining pages. This way, you won't lose your skills in layout when the selection processes arrive.
